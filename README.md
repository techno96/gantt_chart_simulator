# Gantt Chart simulation for process overlap

This is a primitive simulator that allows you to visualize how process overlap and scheduling happens in an Operating System using a Gantt Chart, by utilizing process burst times.

It provides a visualization for the following scheduling strategies : 

* FCFS (First Come First Serve)
* SHORTEST JOB FIRST(non-preemptive)
* SHORTEST JOB FIRST(preemptive)
* ROUND ROBIN
* PRIORITY(non-preemptive)
* PRIORITY(preemptive)

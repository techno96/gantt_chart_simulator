# gantt_chart_simulator
Gantt Chart simulation for process overlap

This is a primitive simulator that allows you to visualize how process overlap and scheduling happens in an Operating System using a Gantt Chart, by utilizing process burst times.

It provides a visualization for the following scheduling strategies : 

1-FCFS
2-SHORTEST JOB FIRST(non-preemptive)
3-SHORTEST JOB FIRST(preemptive)
4-ROUND ROBIN
5-PRIORITY(non-preemptive)
6-PRIORITY(preemptive)
